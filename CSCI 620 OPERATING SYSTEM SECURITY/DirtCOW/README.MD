# Dirty COW Vulnerability Analysis (CVE-2016-5195)

## Overview
This assignment focuses on analyzing the Dirty COW (Copy-On-Write) vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195), a privilege escalation bug in the Linux kernel. You will explore its technical details, exploitation methods, impact, and mitigation strategies.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the technical nature of the Dirty COW vulnerability.
- Analyze how race conditions in the Linux kernel can lead to privilege escalation.
- Implement and test an exploit in a controlled environment (if permitted).
- Research and propose mitigation strategies to prevent exploitation.

## Assignment Tasks

### 1. Research and Documentation
- Explain the concept of the Copy-On-Write (COW) mechanism in the Linux kernel.
- Define what a race condition is and how it is exploited in Dirty COW.
- Provide a step-by-step breakdown of how the vulnerability works.
- Discuss real-world examples of how Dirty COW has been exploited.
- Outline the impact of this vulnerability on Linux systems.

### 2. Hands-On Analysis (Optional / If Permitted)
- Set up a virtual machine with a vulnerable kernel version.
- Compile and run a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit in a controlled environment.
- Analyze and document the exploitâ€™s behavior.
- Provide a summary of the observed privilege escalation process.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies
- Research and document official patches released to address Dirty COW.
- Explain how kernel updates and live patching solutions (e.g., kpatch) mitigate the issue.
- Discuss additional security measures, such as access control and secrets management.
- Explore automated scanning tools for identifying vulnerable kernel versions.
- Propose a best-practice security approach to minimize the risks associated with similar vulnerabilities.

## Deliverables
- A written report (PDF format) covering:
  - Technical analysis of Dirty COW
  - Exploit methodology (if applicable)
  - Real-world case studies
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Conclusions and recommendations
- Any PoC code (if applicable and permitted), along with execution logs/screenshots.

## Submission Guidelines
- Format: IEEE (cite sources properly).
- Length: 3-6 pages (excluding references and appendices).
- Deadline: X.
- Submit via CANVAS in format PDF.
